# Declarations, Initialization, Assignment, and Re-Assignment 10/20/22
 ## Declaration in JavaScript
  * A variable declaration is a statement that asks the Javascript compliler to reserve a certain amount of space for a value with a name attched. 

 ## Initialization in JavaScript
  * If the value is left un-inilized Javascript will automatiically inilize the value as undefined.
  * Delcaring and inlizing the variable and value in global scope will make it accesible from all scopes.  

 ## Assignment
  * Assignment is when we tell javascript to bind a variable to a value using the ```=``` token. 
  > There is a subtle difference in terminology surrounding the ```=``` token. When used in a declaration, the ```=``` is just a syntactic token that tells JavaScript that you're going to supply an initial value for the variable. However, in an assignment, the = is called the assignment operator. For example, in ```let firstName = 'Mitchell'```, the ```=``` is a syntactic token, but in ```firstName = 'Martha'```, it is the assignment operator.

 ## Re-assignment
  * Re-assignment is when we have a varaible already bound to a value and we use the ```=``` token  to re-assign the value of the variable to a new value. We are not changing the varaible object, but just its value. See bellow for a deatiled quote.  
  > On line 2, we reassign the value 42 to the variable named answer. That is, JavaScript makes answer refer to a new value. It's important to realize that we're not changing the value of 41 -- we're assigning a completely new value to the answer variable.
